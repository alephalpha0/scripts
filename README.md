#### `termux-url-opener` is a logic train that takes a url as input and decides what method to use to download the prize. Requires `wget` and `youtube-dlc` at this moment. More knowledge is requred on my part before I can do more options (eg, `curl` or `you-get` or etc.) 

#### `rootofpisync` needs a better name, first of all. this script uses `rsync` to move a copy of my site directory from termux to internal storage on my phone. that's it!
